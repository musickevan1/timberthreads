<objective>
Guide the user through assembling the full promo video timeline in DaVinci Resolve with music, ambient audio, and warm color grading, then validate all Phase 7 master exports (hero + promo).

Purpose: The promo video is the primary marketing deliverable — a 1-2 minute property tour combining aerial drone footage and interior shots with background music. This plan produces the master export that Phase 8 will compress for web delivery. Validation ensures all exports meet the quality requirements for downstream compression.

Output: Promo master export(s) in processing/exports/promo/, validated master files for both hero and promo ready for Phase 8

  <name>Task 1: Assemble promo video timeline with music and ambient audio</name>
  <files>processing/exports/promo/</files>
  <action>
User performs creative editing in DaVinci Resolve: assembles 1-2 minute promo video timeline with drone + interior footage, selects and syncs music track, mixes ambient audio, applies warm color grading consistent with hero loops, and exports ProRes 422 master(s) to processing/exports/promo/.
  </action>
  <verify>ls processing/exports/promo/*.mov shows at least 1 promo master file exists</verify>
  <done>Promo video master exported as ProRes 422 with music, ambient audio, and warm color grading. Timeline versions maintained per EDIT-04.</done>
  <instructions>
**What you need to do:**

In DaVinci Resolve (same project from Plan 07-01), assemble the full promo video.

**Step 1: Select or obtain music track**

You need an acoustic/gentle piano track for the promo background music.

Options:
- **Artlist.io** — Subscription service, unlimited commercial license. Search "gentle piano" or "acoustic calm"
- **Bensound.com** — Free with attribution, or paid for no-attribution. Try "Tenderness" or "A New Beginning"
- **TunePocket.com** — Subscription, unlimited commercial license. Search "calm acoustic"

IMPORTANT: Verify the license allows commercial use on a business website. Import the selected track into the Audio bin in Resolve.

**Step 2: Create promo timeline**

1. Edit Page > Create timeline "Promo_v1" (30fps, 1920x1080)
2. Target duration: 1-2 minutes (60-120 seconds)
3. Add music track to Audio Track 1

**Step 3: Assemble visual story**

Suggested structure (adjust based on your creative vision):
- **0:00-0:15** — Aerial establishing shots (drone footage of island, lake, approach)
- **0:15-0:30** — Property exterior (drone closer shots, grounds)
- **0:30-0:50** — Interior spaces (Canon clips: quilting room, common areas, bedrooms)
- **0:50-1:10** — Activity shots (Canon clips: craft supplies, sewing machines, workspace details)
- **1:10-1:30** — Scenic beauty (drone: sunset/water, property from distance)
- **1:30-1:45** — Final wide aerial (callback to opening, sense of completeness)

Tips:
- Hold drone shots 8-10 seconds (per project edit direction — slow, peaceful pacing)
- Cut on music beats or phrase transitions when possible
- Mix drone and interior to show the full experience
- Reference `processing/catalog/silence-report.txt` to avoid clips with heavy dead air

Available footage:
- 5 drone clips (15.1 min total) — aerial/exterior/scenic
- 21 Canon clips (6.7 min total) — interior/detail shots
- See `processing/catalog/metadata.json` for durations and `processing/catalog/thumbs/` for visual reference

**Step 4: Mix audio**

1. Fairlight Page (or Edit Page audio tracks)
2. Music track: 0dB (or adjust to taste — should be prominent but not overwhelming)
3. Canon clip ambient audio: -12dB to -18dB (subtle presence of birds, room tone, activity sounds)
4. Add crossfades between audio clips to prevent pops/clicks
5. If Canon clips have unwanted loud sounds, either mute that clip's audio or reduce further

**Step 5: Apply warm color grading**

1. Color Page > Apply saved Still from hero work (Plan 07-01) as starting point
2. Adjust per-clip as needed — drone outdoor and Canon indoor footage will need different tuning
3. Use Split Screen mode to compare drone/Canon clips side-by-side for consistency
4. Goal: Consistent warm aesthetic across entire promo (no jarring color shifts between shots)

**Step 6: Review and version**

1. Play through entire promo timeline start to finish
2. Check: pacing feels calm? Music and visuals sync? Color consistent? Audio balanced?
3. If satisfied: duplicate timeline as "Promo_FINAL"
4. If revisions needed: duplicate as "Promo_v2", make changes, repeat

**Step 7: Export promo master**

1. Deliver Page for promo timeline:
   - Format: QuickTime
   - Codec: Apple ProRes 422 (or DNxHR HQ)
   - Resolution: 1920x1080
   - Frame Rate: 30fps
   - Audio Codec: Linear PCM (uncompressed) or AAC 256kbps
   - Audio Channels: Stereo
   - Filename: Promo_v1_master.mov (and Promo_FINAL_master.mov if different)
   - Render Location: `[project_root]/processing/exports/promo/`
2. Add to Render Queue > Start Render
3. Export ALL versions (v1, v2, FINAL) per EDIT-04 requirement

**When complete:** Type "promo exports done" with notes on: music track used (name, source, license type), final duration, number of timeline versions, and any creative decisions made.
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>Type "promo exports done" with music track info, final duration, timeline versions created, and creative notes</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Validate all Phase 7 master exports</name>
  <files>processing/exports/hero/, processing/exports/promo/</files>
  <action>
Validate ALL master exports from both Plan 07-01 (hero) and this plan (promo) using ffprobe. This is the quality gate before Phase 8 web compression.

For each file in `processing/exports/hero/` and `processing/exports/promo/`:

```bash
ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams "$file"
```

**Hero exports validation criteria:**
- Codec: prores (or dnxhd for DNxHR)
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Frame rate: ~30fps (29.97 acceptable)
- Audio streams: NONE (hero is muted per HERO-01)
- Duration: within confirmed target range from Task 2 of Plan 07-01
- File size: reasonable for ProRes (expect 50-500MB per clip depending on duration)

**Promo exports validation criteria:**
- Codec: prores (or dnxhd for DNxHR)
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Frame rate: ~30fps (29.97 acceptable)
- Audio streams: at least 1 stereo audio track (music + ambient)
- Duration: 60-120 seconds (1-2 minutes target)
- File size: reasonable for ProRes (expect 500MB-2GB for 1-2 min)

**Validation output:**

Print a summary table for all exports:

```
| File | Codec | Resolution | FPS | Audio | Duration | Size | Status |
|------|-------|------------|-----|-------|----------|------|--------|
```

Mark each file PASS or FAIL. If any FAIL, report specific issue.

Also verify timeline versioning (EDIT-04):
- At least 2-3 hero candidates exist
- At least 1 promo version exists (v1 minimum, FINAL preferred)

If validation passes, print: "All Phase 7 master exports validated. Ready for Phase 8 web compression."
If validation fails, describe failures so user can fix in Resolve and re-export.
  </action>
  <verify>
- All files in processing/exports/hero/ pass ffprobe validation
- All files in processing/exports/promo/ pass ffprobe validation
- Hero files have no audio stream
- Promo files have audio stream
- Duration ranges match targets
- At least 2 hero candidates + 1 promo version exist
  </verify>
  <done>
All master exports validated: hero loops are ProRes 1080p30 muted, promo is ProRes 1080p30 with audio, all durations within target range, timeline versioning requirement met. Phase 7 complete and ready for Phase 8 web compression.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After all tasks complete:

1. Promo exports exist:
   ```bash
   ls -la processing/exports/promo/
   ```
   Should contain at least 1 Promo_*_master.mov file

2. All exports validated:
   ```bash
   for f in processing/exports/hero/*.mov processing/exports/promo/*.mov; do
     echo "=== $(basename $f) ==="
     ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams "$f" | jq '{codec: .streams[0].codec_name, resolution: "\(.streams[0].width)x\(.streams[0].height)", fps: .streams[0].r_frame_rate, duration: .format.duration, size_mb: (.format.size | tonumber / 1048576 | floor)}'
   done
   ```

3. Phase 7 requirement checklist:
   - EDIT-01: All footage color graded with warm tones (user confirmed during hero + promo work)
   - EDIT-02: Music synced with visual pacing (user confirmed in promo)
   - EDIT-03: Master exports are ProRes/DNxHR (verified by ffprobe)
   - EDIT-04: Timeline versions maintained (multiple hero candidates + promo versions)
   - HERO-04: 2-3 hero loop candidates prepared for client selection
</verification>

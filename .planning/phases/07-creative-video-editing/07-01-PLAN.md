<objective>
Prepare the exports directory structure, resolve the hero loop duration question, and guide the user through creating 2-3 hero loop candidates in DaVinci Resolve with warm color grading.

Purpose: This plan bridges Phase 6 (preprocessed clips) and the creative editing work. Claude creates the file structure and workflow documentation, then the user performs the creative work in DaVinci Resolve — setting up the project, selecting drone footage for hero loops, applying warm color grading, and exporting ProRes master files.

Output: Directory structure for exports, workflow guide document, confirmed hero loop duration, 2-3 hero loop master exports in processing/exports/hero/

  <name>Task 1: Create exports directory structure and Resolve workflow guide</name>

Create the exports directory structure that DaVinci Resolve will render into:

```
processing/exports/
├── hero/      # Hero loop master exports (ProRes 422)
└── promo/     # Promo video master exports (ProRes 422)
```

Create `processing/exports/hero/.gitkeep` and `processing/exports/promo/.gitkeep` to track empty directories.

Then create `.planning/phases/07-creative-video-editing/resolve-workflow-guide.md` — a comprehensive step-by-step guide for DaVinci Resolve operations covering:

**Section 1: Project Setup**
- Create new project "Timber & Threads Promo"
- Set Project Settings: Timeline resolution 1920x1080, Timeline frame rate 30fps (matches drone footage — Canon 60fps clips auto-conform via optical flow)
- Create bins in Media Pool: Drone, Canon, Audio, Graphics

**Section 2: Media Import**
- Import `processing/trimmed/drone/` folder into Drone bin (5 clips, 15.1 min total)
- Import `processing/trimmed/interior/` folder into Canon bin (21 clips, 6.7 min total)
- Verify all clips linked (no red "Media Offline" icons)
- Verify DJI metadata preserved (check stabilization panel for gyroscope data on drone clips)

**Section 3: Hero Loop Workflow** (use confirmed duration from Task 2)
- Create timeline "Hero_v1" (30fps, 1920x1080)
- Select drone clips with smooth pan/orbit motion (best for looping)
- Available drone clips with durations:
  - DJI_0014.MP4: 154.0s — scrub for best 15-30s segment
  - DJI_0015.MP4: 133.9s
  - DJI_0016.MP4: 110.9s
  - DJI_0017.MP4: 157.7s
  - DJI_0018.MP4_fixed.MP4: 349.8s (longest, most options)
- Trim to target duration, test loop: Right-click timeline > Loop Playback
- Watch end-to-start transition 3+ cycles. If jarring, adjust Out point or add 0.5-1s Cross Dissolve
- Duplicate timeline for each candidate: Hero_v1, Hero_v2, Hero_v3

**Section 4: Warm Color Grading (Hero)**
- Color Page > Primary Wheels panel
- Temperature slider: +10 to +20 (subtle warmth, not overdone)
- Lift Wheel (shadows): Push toward orange (lower-right quadrant), reduce blue
- Gamma Wheel (midtones): Push toward yellow-orange for warm midtones
- Gain Wheel (highlights): Slight orange push (careful — avoid over-saturation)
- Goal: Peaceful, cozy, inviting feel. NOT Hollywood orange-and-teal. Think warm sunset, cabin glow.
- Save grade as Still (right-click in Gallery) for reuse in promo video (Plan 07-02)

**Section 5: Hero Master Export**
- Deliver Page for each hero timeline (Hero_v1, Hero_v2, Hero_v3):
  - Format: QuickTime
  - Codec: Apple ProRes 422 (or DNxHR HQ if on Linux/Windows without ProRes)
  - Resolution: 1920x1080
  - Frame Rate: 30fps
  - Audio: None (hero is muted per HERO-01)
  - Filename: Hero_v1_master.mov, Hero_v2_master.mov, Hero_v3_master.mov
  - Render Location: `[project_root]/processing/exports/hero/`
- Add to Render Queue > Start Render
- Verify renders complete without errors

Include a note at the top of the guide: "This guide accompanies Phase 7 plan execution. Follow sections in order. Duration placeholder [HERO_DURATION] will be filled after Task 2 decision."

  <name>Task 2: Confirm hero loop target duration</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/07-creative-video-editing/resolve-workflow-guide.md</files>
  <action>
Present the hero loop duration decision to the user. After user selects, update the resolve-workflow-guide.md from Task 1 to replace [HERO_DURATION] placeholder with the confirmed duration range.

Decision context:
- Original requirement (HERO-04): 15-30 seconds per hero loop candidate
- Web best practice research: 6-8 seconds optimal, 10-15 seconds maximum
- Hero video is muted, autoplaying, compressed to &lt;5MB at 720p (longer = lower quality per frame)
- Available drone footage: 5 clips totaling 15.1 minutes (plenty for any duration)

Options:
- short: 6-8 seconds (web optimized, smallest file, most seamless feel)
- medium: 10-15 seconds (compromise, good variety + performance)
- long: 15-30 seconds (original requirement, maximum variety, larger file)
  </action>
  <verify>resolve-workflow-guide.md has been updated with confirmed duration (no [HERO_DURATION] placeholders remain)</verify>
  <done>Hero loop target duration confirmed by user and documented in workflow guide</done>
  <decision>Hero loop target duration for website background video</decision>
  <context>
There is a conflict between the original project requirements and web best practices research:

**Original requirement (HERO-04):** 15-30 seconds per hero loop candidate
**Web best practice research:** 6-8 seconds optimal, 10-15 seconds maximum

Why this matters:
- **Longer loops (15-30s):** More footage variety, tells more of a story, but larger file size (closer to 5MB limit), slower page load, delayed loop restart perception
- **Shorter loops (6-8s):** Faster page load, smaller file, more seamless feel, but less footage variety
- **Compromise (10-15s):** Balance of variety and performance

The hero video is muted (HERO-01), autoplaying, and will be compressed to <5MB at 720p in Phase 8. The compression script (compress-hero.sh) uses calculated bitrate: longer duration = lower video quality per frame.

Available drone footage: 5 clips totaling 15.1 minutes. Plenty of footage for any duration choice.

  <instructions>
**What you need to do:**

Open DaVinci Resolve and follow the workflow guide created in Task 1 (`.planning/phases/07-creative-video-editing/resolve-workflow-guide.md`), Sections 1-5.

**Step-by-step summary:**

1. **Create Project** (Section 1)
   - New Project: "Timber & Threads Promo"
   - Project Settings > Master Settings: 1920x1080, 30fps
   - Create bins: Drone, Canon, Audio, Graphics

2. **Import Media** (Section 2)
   - Import `processing/trimmed/drone/` into Drone bin
   - Import `processing/trimmed/interior/` into Canon bin
   - Verify no "Media Offline" errors

3. **Assemble Hero Loops** (Section 3)
   - Create Hero_v1 timeline from best drone segment
   - Target duration: [DECIDED IN TASK 2] seconds
   - Test loop playback 3+ cycles — adjust if end-to-start transition is jarring
   - Duplicate timeline, create Hero_v2 from different drone clip/segment
   - Optionally create Hero_v3 (minimum 2 candidates required)

4. **Color Grade Hero Clips** (Section 4)
   - Apply warm color grading on Color Page
   - Temperature +10 to +20, push shadows/midtones toward orange, reduce blue
   - Goal: warm, cozy, inviting (NOT over-saturated orange)
   - Save grade as Still for reuse in promo (Plan 07-02)

5. **Export Hero Masters** (Section 5)
   - Deliver Page: QuickTime, ProRes 422, 1920x1080, 30fps, No Audio
   - Render to: `processing/exports/hero/`
   - Filename pattern: Hero_v1_master.mov, Hero_v2_master.mov, etc.

**When complete:** Type "hero exports done" with any notes about which candidate you think looks best, and any creative decisions made (clip choices, grade intensity, etc.)
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>Type "hero exports done" and describe which clips were used, how many candidates created, and any notes on the color grade</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

After all tasks complete:

1. Directory structure verification:
   ```bash
   ls -la processing/exports/hero/
   ```
   Should contain 2-3 Hero_v*_master.mov files (ProRes 422)

2. Master export validation (for each hero file):
   ```bash
   ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams processing/exports/hero/Hero_v1_master.mov
   ```
   Verify:
   - Codec: prores (or dnxhd)
   - Resolution: 1920x1080

  <files>Invoice-TT-2026-001.pdf</files>
  <action>
Verify that the existing invoice PDF at Invoice-TT-2026-001.pdf meets all requirements:

1. Check file exists and is a valid PDF (file size indicates content)
2. Confirm invoice includes:
   - Evan Musick as service provider
   - Timber & Threads Retreat as client
   - Itemized line items for:
     * Video shoot: $250
     * Video editing: $100
     * Website updates: $150
   - Total: $500

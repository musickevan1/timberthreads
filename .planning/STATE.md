# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** The promo video and site improvements must make the retreat feel warm, inviting, and real — showcasing the unique island property in a way that makes quilters and crafters want to book a stay.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.1 — Promo Video Edit

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Cloudinary for gallery - Already half-built in codebase, solves persistence + CDN + transforms
- Self-hosted video - Client wants no third-party branding on the video player
- Hero clip decided post-shoot - Need to see footage before choosing the best hero clip
- $400-600 total project - Fair for rural MO market, maintains client relationship

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Timeline constraint:** All work must complete by Feb 22 (1 week after shoot). Video editing is on the critical path for Phase 3 (Video Integration).

**Raw footage note:** DJI_0018.MP4 is corrupt — skip during processing.

**Work split:** Creative editing (assembly, pacing, color grading, music) happens in DaVinci Resolve manually. CLI handles cataloging, trimming, compression, and poster extraction.

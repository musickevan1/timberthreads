## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Cloudinary for gallery - Already half-built in codebase, solves persistence + CDN + transforms
- Self-hosted video - Client wants no third-party branding on the video player
- Hero clip decided post-shoot - Need to see footage before choosing the best hero clip
- $400-600 total project - Fair for rural MO market, maintains client relationship

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 3 blocker:** Video integration depends on Feb 15 shoot completion. Cannot select hero clip or integrate videos until footage is captured and edited.

**Timeline constraint:** All work must complete by Feb 22 (1 week after shoot). Tight timeline requires efficient execution across all phases.

**Budget constraint:** $400-600 total project requires staying on Cloudinary/Vercel free tiers. Monitor bandwidth usage during Phase 4 to avoid overage charges.
